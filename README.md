Overview
======
This R script is to preprocess and normalize data generated with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array (450K).

Whole blood was collected from 95 individuals from the [Costa Rican Berkeley CRELES cohort](http://www.creles.berkeley.edu/). We sampled from the Nicoyan population ('Nicoyans',n=47) and from other regions of Costa Rica('Controls' or 'non-Nicoyans',n=47). The Nicoya peninsula hosts a population of Costa Rica that exceed expected life expectancy, see [Luis Rosero-Bixby et al., 2013](http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC4241350/). The goal of this study was to explore the epigenetics (DNA methylation) of Nicoyan individuals as compared to non-Nicoyans, considering that DNA methylation is closely related to biological aging. 

Study Design: 
95 samples + 1 technical replicate, randomly distributed across 12 arrays ("chips", as each chip has 12 samples) run in one batch.
