Overview

This R script is to preprocess and normalize data generated with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array (450K).

Whole blood was collected from 95 individuals from the Costa Rican Berkeley CRELES cohort. We sampled from the Nicoyan population ('Nicoyans',n=47) and from other regions of Costa Rica('Controls' or 'non-Nicoyans',n=47). The Nicoya peninsula hosts a population of Costa Rica that exceed expected life expectancy, see Luis Rosero-Bixby et al., 2013. The goal of this study was to explore the epigenetics (DNA methylation) of Nicoyan individuals as compared to non-Nicoyans, considering that DNA methylation is closely related to biological aging.

Study Design: 95 samples + 1 technical replicate, randomly distributed across 12 arrays ("chips", as each chip has 12 samples) run in one batch.
